### 0xBTC LP Tokens

0xBTC Liquidty Pool Tokens are provided to you when you 'pool liquidity' of 0xBTC and Matic tokens on [https://swapmatic.io](https://swapmatic.io).

In order to do this, you first need to have a balance of Matic and 0xBTC on the Matic Network.   If you only have one of these assets on the Matic Network, you can swap half of it for the other asset at [https://swapmatic.io/swap](https://swapmatic.io/swap).  (Please note that you will need at least a small amount of Matic to pay for gas.)

#### Pool Your Liquidity

Once you have some 0xBTC tokens and some Matic tokens on the Matic Network in your account, visit [https://swapmatic.io/add-liquidity](https://swapmatic.io/add-liquidity) and select 'Matic' and '0xBTC' and click 'Approve' and then 'Add Liquidity'.

Once that transaction is sucessful, your tokens will be earning fees and the exchange will give you a '0xBTC LP Token' which represents your share of the pool.  Do not lose it!  You can use it later to unpool your funds, giving you 0xBTC, Matic, and all fees accrued by other traders.
