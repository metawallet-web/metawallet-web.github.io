### Earn ALIENs

To Earn Aliens, you must first have some 0xBTC Liquidity tokens that you received from SwapMatic.io by Pooling Liquidity.  Once you have these, visit Invader.Finance and select 'Stake LP Token to Invader' to convert your LP Tokens to 'Invader Tokens'.

#### Invader (NVDR)

Invader Tokens are simply a branded, tradeable and stakeable version of the 0xBTC LP token.  Invader 'NVDR' can be atomically swapped for '0xBTC LP' at a 1:1 ratio at anytime using the Invader Contract or by using Invader.Finance dapp.   By holding Invader, just like by holding '0xBTC LP', you are earning trading fees from traders on Swapmatic.io


#### Aliens (ALN)

Once you have Invader Tokens, select 'InvaderToken' as your asset on Invader.Finance and then click 'Approve Invader to Stake' and then 'Stake Invader to Farm Aliens'.  You can unstake your Invader at any time for no penalty.  While your Invader is staked, you will notice that you are earning ALIEN tokens over time!

 You can claim these ALIEN at any time.  You can stake more NDVR at any time or unstake some or all of your NVDR at any time.  Whenever you stake or unstake your NVDR, your pending aliens will be claimed and sent to your account.
