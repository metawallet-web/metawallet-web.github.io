Now you can use Matic Applications on the internet!

#### Getting some Matic
Now that you have Metamask configured, you will need some MATIC on the Matic Network to start performing transactions.  First, acquire some Matic on the Ethereum Mainnet using an exchange such as Binance or Uniswap.   

Next, you can use [https://wallet.0xbtc.io](https://wallet.0xbtc.io) or [https://wallet.matic.network](https://wallet.matic.network) to bridge your MATIC and other assets such as 0xBTC into the Matic Network.  The bridging process can take up to 15 minutes once your transaction is mined on the Ethereum Mainnet.

You can see your matic balance in your same Ethereum Account public address on [https://explorer.matic.network](https://explorer.matic.network)
